By doing this subject, I wanted to build devices and program them with software. In thinking of what device to make, I decided to think of current issues affecting our daily lives. Since sustainability is an issue that is becoming more present in our day-to-day lives, I decided that I would try to help solve the problem especically in regards to recyclable waste. Australia has an excess of recyclable waste as China has implemented new policies to only accept recycling that is 99.5% uncontaminated. It is also estimated that 10% of materials in recyclable bins are not recyclable. By reducing this number, it means that more waste will become uncontaminated and thus more waste will be utilised in this current climate. Therefore the device I plan to build is a material detection device used to sort recyclable materials with recycling companies as the main client in mind. 

On the first day, we delved right into building a device. I had never soldered and it was a skill I needed to learn in order to be able to build a device later on.  The first day was the first time I had placed components onto a printed circuit board and soldered them on. I have now soldered two things, the components for a data-logger and an header pins on to an esp8266 MCU. Also, I have never heard of Blynk prior to the first day and it was an amazing experience to be able to see how powerful it was. Now using the Blynk app is one thing but controlling through the Blynk api is infinitely harder. I installed PlatformIO through Microsoft Visual Studio, and thus was able to download the Blynk library, with great difficulty. 

Initially I decided to create my own website from scratch with hosting from GitHub. However, I discovered, after initially setting up my website, that it was going to take too long for me to create on from scratch as I would need to create and learn at the same time. Therefore, when taking a quick break, I decided surf around GitHub and more specifically the style of website that GitHub uses, Jekyll. Upon further browsing, I discovered ready made templates that other users had created and the one I chose is called “beautiful-Jekyll” (it is linked at the bottom of my web-page). Another reason why I chose this theme was because the it was written in markdown which is a another way of writing web pages without using HTML and is much more user-friendly. 

Now while deciding what to build took up some time, deciding ways in which it was feasible took even longer. The first challenge was attempting to develop a process by which I would be able to differentiate between different recyclable materials. Since the easiest task would be to determine whether a product is a metal or not, I would start with a more difficult material – paper. The thought process is that paper should have a reflective property that is unique to other materials, say for example plastic and measuring the amount of light reflected will hopefully give so me data to support this. The LED and photo-resistor must be next to each other as depicted in order for the light from the LED to be reflected back on to the photo-resistor.

To do this I had to learn how to build a simple circuit with an LED on it. I learnt that the reason why resistors are needed on circuits is absorb the remaining voltage to avoid a burnout of the LED. So far, I have only set-up a simple circuit with an LED and a photo-resistor and created a bash script to turn it on and off from the console. This studio is the first time I have used or seen a  breadboard and my first time wiring a circuit. With great help from Danon and another classmate Matt, I was able to get the circuit wired and the LED on. The next challenge was finding a way turn the led on and off instead of being in an always on state.

Using the Blynk api which I had played with previously and again with help, I was able to control the LED switch from the Blynk app and now from the computer as well. Then by writing a simple bash script using curl, I was able to from terminal execute the command to control the LED. This was essentially a vary rudimentary version controlling a device via code. The next step in this process is to be able to get a reading from my photo-resistor and obtain a stronger LED in order for testing of materials to begin.
