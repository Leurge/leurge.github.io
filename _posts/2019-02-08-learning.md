By doing this subject, I wanted to build devices and program them with software. In thinking of what device to make, I decided to think of current issues affecting our daily lives. Since sustainability is an issue that is becoming more present in our day-to-day lives, I decided that I would use this subject as an opportunity to explore ways in which to tackle the issue.  Australia has an excess of recyclable waste as China has implemented new policies to only accept recycling that is 99.5% uncontaminated. It is also estimated that 10% of materials in recyclable bins are not recyclable. By reducing this number, it means that more waste will become uncontaminated and thus more waste will be utilised in this current climate. Therefore the device I plan to build is a material detection device used to sort recyclable materials.
