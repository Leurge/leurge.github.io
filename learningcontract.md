# Learning Contract
In this subject we have been assigned a learning contract to complete. To my understanding this is a set of objectives that we would like to get out of the course and how we would go about completing them.

Initially I was drawn to this subject because of the opportunity to be able to learn how to build my own data collecting device. It makes sense then that my first objective is to build my own data collecting device. In this case, the device is a material detection device, specifically used to sort recyclable materials. However this objective is quite ambitious and I have no experience in any circuitry prior to this studio so I will break it down into simpler and more achievable objectives.

Firstly, I hope to learn how to be able to build one of the sensors required for my device. It is obviously ideal to have a completed device prototype by the end of this studio but I believe it is an unrealistic expectation for me to have. I have never built a circuit before so configuring a simple circuit will already be an important learning experience. In order to be able to build a sensor I will be using the various resources available to me such as other prototypes made by students, guidance from the tutor and resources online in order to learn more. If I have increased my knowledge of how circuits operate and am able to independently wire my circuit, then I will have completed this objective.

Inherently, with hardware comes software. Secondly, I would like to learn more about coding in order to program my device in order to operate it the way I want it too. Ideally, the more languages I am able to interact with the better. To achieve this, a great deal of reading is necessary as well as plenty of collaboration with peers and the tutor. My device therefore, should be able to controlled with code and able to interact the way I want. If I have increased my exposure to code and implemented it in a practical manner, then I have fulfilled this objective.

Finally, the last objective is one that is related to the second; data. More specifically, how to upload the data from the device to the cloud and how to access the data from the cloud. Furthermore, I would like to see if I can spot out trends or patterns across the data. With regards to my project, it would seeing if I could spot a trend with certain materials for example if they are particular reflective compared to other materials. Learning Node.js and the MQTT messaging protocol is a great start to be able to accomplish this task. My device should be able to upload data to the cloud and another device should be able get data from the cloud to fulfil the final objective.

A condensed version of my learning contract would look like this:
